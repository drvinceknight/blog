<p>A post describing some of the approaches I have used to adapt to the changes imposed by safety measures.</p>



<h2> Adapting to blended learning </h2>
<h3> 2020-11-24 </h3>

<hr />
<p>I have recently been asked to provide some text for a newsletter "about how well
our academic staff have adapted to teaching in a different way ie blended
learning". Apparently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[I] have been very successful in doing this."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before describing what I have done to adapt to the new situation I want to pause
at that comment. I asked where they'd heard that (and won't bore us with the
details here) but <em>fundamentally</em>:</p>
<p><strong>I do not know if what I am about to describe has been successful or not</strong></p>
<p>I take pride in using an evidence based approach in my pedagogy. I describe it
here: https://vknight.org/tch-phi/. However, with COVID I have not had
the time to read what research has been done on teaching in these circumstances
(and there is a growing set of literature, for example:
<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA168-2.html">https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA168-2.html</a>).</p>
<p><strong>What I have done</strong></p>
<p>I have aimed to stick to the following evidence based principles of my teaching
philosophy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove friction from transfer of content to concentrate on an active learning
  framework used appropriately for inquiry, peer based activities, reactive
  discussion.</li>
<li>Open discussion with students not just about the course but how the course is
  taught.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To remove friction from transfer of content</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All of my content has been written in a Jupyter book <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html">https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html</a> (the course is a programming course so this is well suited but not exclusive).</li>
<li>A lot of software is used to check the notes for me (language, typos and
  results). Information about how this is done is here: <a href="https://vknight.org/pfm/about-this-book/how-is-this-book-written/main.html">https://vknight.org/pfm/about-this-book/how-is-this-book-written/main.html</a>
  Whatever time I spend with students I want to minimise the time I spend fixing
  small errors on my part (there have still been many).</li>
<li>Answers to a number of potential questions are written in the Jupyter book.
  Many questions from students can then be answered and accompanied with a url to specific answers.</li>
<li>Avoid files. This is a common practice in remote workplaces: do not send files
  that need to be downloaded back and forth. <strong>Send urls</strong>. As things get updated
  these do not go out of date (files do).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To create an active learning environment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I use Zoom for my classes. The chat feature is fundamental here. I encourage
  the chat room to be as noisy an distracting as possible. We will sometimes get
  distracted by discussion of pancakes versus crepes but mainly get distracted
  by specific questions that take me down a different course than the one
  planned.</li>
<li>I plan every Zoom class. I mainly follow the specific chapter from the notes
  but always do a different problem. I write my plan and like with everything
  else I make that plan available to students. They can look at it before class
  (I encourage it) but most importantly if we don't stick to the plan: that plan
  is available to them.</li>
<li>I have started every class with breakout rooms asking students to discuss how
  they would solve a particular problem. This gives time and space for students
  to think about the problem and results in the aforementioned fantastically
  noisy chat room.</li>
<li>Over the week I obtain feedback about specific difficulties students have had
  an go over that in a further class or record a video that I share with them.
  (I again plan and share my plan.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Most of the above is not necessarily different from <em>pre COVID</em> times</strong></p>
<p>A part from the use of Zoom that's a very similar approach to what I have done
in usual times.</p>
<p><strong>Specific things I have done related to the COVID</strong></p>
<p>I've been aware of the lack of opportunity to "bump" in to someone in a corridor
and the chats that happen that way.</p>
<p>As such I've setup a <a href="https://discord.com">discord server</a> for students to chat
to me but also to chat amongst themselves. I've encouraged not only discussions
about the course but also general chats about pets and other things like that.
This has been something I've certainly enjoyed as it has been nice to get to
know some students. Probably slightly more than I'd get to know in normal
circumstances.</p>
<p>I have used online chat services in the past but this is something that's worked
far better than previous years.</p>
<p><strong>Discussions about the pedagogy.</strong></p>
<p>I have had many ongoing discussions with students about how the class is going
and what we are trying to achieve but these have all been very informal.
Examples include using an informal poll about how some things have felt for
them.</p>

     class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"
     width="40%"></p>
<p><strong>What will I do when things are "normal"</strong></p>
<p>One of the specific prompt questions that was sent to me when I was asked to
write a few words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you continue to use any of these methods when the pandemic is no longer
an issue?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's very little I would change. The pedagogic principles I've used still
apply.</p>
<p>For the specific course I'm teaching the use of zoom breakout rooms as well as
screen sharing and remote controlling of desktops is arguably slightly better
(on some dimensions) than face to face.</p>
<p>The human contact of a face to face office hour session however is certainly
something I'd eagerly go back to. However, I would probably change my office
hours to now both be virtual and face to face. I've had a student "come to my
office hours" while walking their dog. That's probably not a student who I'd
have been able to help if they had had to come my office.</p>
<p>As I stated at the start of this rambling blog post: <strong>I do not know if this
has been successful</strong>.</p>
<p>For the students that I notice? Yes this is going very well. There's an
inherent bias there. The chat room is often TOO engaged (which is fantastic)
but is this creating barriers for other students?</p>
<p>The above questions are no different to normal circumstances but I
hypothesise that it's easier to see the engaged students in these circumstances.</p>
<p>Measuring the effectiveness and reactively modifying the pedagogic approach
would be top of my priority list. Frankly: it's not something I personally
have capacity for right now.</p>
<p>This is hard, everyone is doing their best.</p>
<p>Be there for your students, listen and speak to them.</p>
