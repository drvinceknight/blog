<p>Reviewing a preprint looking at student performance vs interaction behaviour in video</p>



<h2> Review of an arxiv preprint about student interaction with video </h2>
<h3> 2018-07-11 </h3>

<hr />
<p>This short post will give a brief overview describing my thoughts about a
preprint that appeared recently entitled "Examining the relationship between
student performance and video interactions":
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01912">arxiv.org/abs/1807.01912</a>.</p>
<p>The paper tackles an interesting area of research and one that I was not fully
aware of. One of the nice things about it, is the early paragraphs which
highlight some details about the literature. As an example I was not aware of
the work of Brinton and Chiang who in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7218617/">"MOOC performance prediction via
clickstream data and social learning
networks"</a> apparently study
relationship between how students interact with videos and perform on tests
carried out immediately after watching the videos.</p>
<p>The main contribution of the paper considered here is that they study the
relationship between student-video interaction and performance on assessment at
a later date. This makes me think that it is attempting to offer a better
understanding of the effect on actual retention (and possibly even
<strong>learning</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For each laboratory assessment, students were required to make a presentation
as a way to demonstrate their understanding of the covered material. The
presentations were then peer-evaluated and graded."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is done by collecting data using the coursera system which is pretty cool
as it seems to capture all sorts of details (for example: number of pauses
etc...).</p>
<p>Finally  two different linear regression models are applied and they
conclude by saying that a linear model is unable to predict performance.
The authors go on to describe a number of improvements that could be made.</p>
<p>This finding about interactions with video are interesting. I suggest they
indicate that consumption of video is still a passive exercise and what
indicates actual performance (or indeed <strong>learning</strong>) would be some measure of
the active process that these videos scaffold.</p>
<p>I'd have two things I'd be interested in seeing:</p>
<ol>
<li>It would be cool if the data could be made openly available (perhaps, as this
   is a preprint, this will be taken care of by the journal).</li>
<li>The pedagogic framework this course sits in, is described as very active: the
   videos are used to ensure class time can be spent doing worthwhile things. I
   wonder if it would be at all possible to supplement the data set with
   information about behaviour during those sessions (percent attendance, degree
   of participation etc...).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong> Very cool research, a great paper with cool results.</p>
