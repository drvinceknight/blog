title: Review of an arxiv preprint about student interaction with video
description: Reviewing a preprint looking at student performance vs interaction behaviour in video
---

This short post will give a brief overview describing my thoughts about a
preprint that appeared recently entitled "Examining the relationship between
student performance and video interactions":
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01912](arxiv.org/abs/1807.01912).

The paper tackles an interesting area of research and one that I was not fully
aware of. One of the nice things about it, is the early paragraphs which
highlight some details about the literature. As an example I was not aware of
the work of Brinton and Chiang who in ["MOOC performance prediction via
clickstream data and social learning
networks"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7218617/) apparently study
relationship between how students interact with videos and perform on tests
carried out immediately after watching the videos.

The main contribution of the paper considered here is that they study the
relationship between student-video interaction and performance on assessment at
a later date. This makes me think that it is attempting to offer a better
understanding of the effect on actual retention (and possibly even
**learning**).

This is done by collecting data using the coursera system which is pretty cool
as it seems to capture all sorts of details (for example: number of pauses
etc...).

Finally  two different linear regression models are applied and they
conclude by saying that a linear model is unable to predict performance.
The authors go on to describe a number of improvements that could be made.

This finding about interactions with video are interesting. I suggest they
indicate that consumption of video is still a passive exercise and what
indicates actual performance (or indeed **learning**) would be some measure of
the active process that these videos scaffold.

I'd have two things I'd be interested in seeing:

1. It would be cool if the data could be made openly available (perhaps, as this
   is a preprint, this will be taken care of by the journal).
2. The pedagogic framework this course sits in, is described as very active: the
   videos are used to ensure class time can be spent doing worthwhile things. I
   wonder if it would be at all possible to supplement the data set with
   information about behaviour during those sessions (percent attendance, degree
   of participation etc...).

**TLDR** Very cool research, a great paper with cool results.
